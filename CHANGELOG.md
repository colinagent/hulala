# Changelog

Every Hulala release is recorded here, and the GitHub Release notes for
`hulala-v<version>` are taken from the same section. One product, one version:
the terminal client and its embedded Host ship together.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
New entries go under `## [Unreleased]`, in one of `### Added`, `### Changed`,
`### Fixed`, `### Removed`, and they are written in English. A released section
is immutable. `bun run changelog:cut` turns the unreleased entries into the
section for the version in `package.json`; `bun run changelog:check` fails when
that version has no section. Releases before 0.2.30 are not recorded.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Every heading level in the editor column has its own colour and its own band:
  level 1 is the palette's red warmed towards its yellow, then yellow, green,
  cyan, blue and magenta, with the band behind the words only as wide as the
  text. The inks are the terminal's own palette colours, undimmed.

## [0.2.31] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- Markdown is rendered in the editor column: headings, code panels, tables,
  checkboxes and quotes, while the line under the cursor keeps its raw source.
  `Space u m` toggles it.
- Mermaid blocks draw their diagram under the fence in the editor column, by the
  same engine the transcript uses.
- Mermaid code blocks in the transcript render as Unicode diagrams; one that
  cannot be drawn keeps its source and names the reason.
- `/changelog` prints this build's changes, and a state root announces them once
  per release after its first Session opens.
- Host commands sit in the `/` menu and the palette beside the client's own, and
  run against the Session's composition.
- A command the Host runs is a step row in the transcript, with a compaction's
  summary folded away until the reader asks for it.

## [0.2.30] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- The terminal client and its embedded Host ship as one archive per platform:
  `bin/hulala`, the Host under `runtime/`, the bundled Neovim and ripgrep, and
  the npm lock `hulala install` resolves the dependencies from.
- Three columns in one window: the Session rail, the conversation, and one
  sidebar that switches between the built-in terminal and Neovim, with `Cmd-E`
  for Neovim alone.
- Neovim opens on the Session directory and is the file tree: the bundled
  explorer replaces netrw, and buffers survive while the column is hidden.
- One Host daemon per state root. Windows attach through `endpoint.json`,
  `Ctrl-Q` detaches, and only `hulala host stop` ends it.
- The Harness surfaces are used directly — streaming output, approvals,
  questions, model selection, cancellation, `/connect` and `/api/remote.mux` —
  on the DSH Agent Loop, with no second Runtime and no second REST layer.
- A client plugin is one `.mjs` file (`hulala plugin new|check|list|disable`),
  and Creator mode lets the agent inspect the client's own Cordis surface.
- Every bundled binary is a real file in `$HULALA_HOME/bin`, appended to a child
  process's `PATH` so an installed tool always wins.
